The idea was to interact with machines with gestures, we have thought of many usecases such as: 1. Driver Drowsiness detection 2. Disabled person -> using gestures to communicate 3. Home automation -> using gestures to turn on/off your device 4. Medical imaging -> robots doing surgery 5. Retail shop -> Search/Inventory exploration, try-on feature. 6. Laptop / Movies, music etc -> Hand gesture control 7. Presentaions, Tv control, Constrained environment(like in noisy environment, inside water Communication etc).

Till now, we have managed to make 4 types of gesture:

head nodding -> yes
head nodding -> no
thumbs up -> for like
Smiley
and made an application which collects survey from user using gestures.

Program is dependent on Dlib, Opencv computer vision and machine learning libraries.
